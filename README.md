# FizzBuzz in mutliple languages

FizzBuzz is a common question in coding interviews. Essentially, you are asked to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of '3', print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of '5' print "Buzz". For multiples of '3' AND '5', print "FizzBuzz".

It would be much better to come up with your own implementation before looking at mine. Interviewers ask questions like these to make sure that you actually know how to code, so if you just copy and paste everything, you might not get far.
